you can combine lots of smaller commands with ls like -r,-l etc
ls variations
cat can be used to add data to a file
eg: cat> filename
add new data
after completion control+d
this will overwrite the data of the file

to append data at the end of the file we write something like:
cat >> filename
write the content
press control d

deleting files:
rm filename

deleting directories:

rm -r directory name
other stuff is there but its too much ig we can just go thru the commands  or maybe we will never use that stuff maybe we use we dont know yet.
