its the job of the programmer to perform user validation such that our 
server dont crash
if a user sends invalid data stuff / even if our server crashes/causes exception
 we dont want users to read our backend logic 
 to avoid this we use global catches


ugly way to do is :
use multiple if else blocks but  its hard to scale 

good way is to use : zod library
everythingg is already immplementtd we just have to use it,, we are parsiing the  input frorom the user
